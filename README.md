Hereby you are able to see my first project using the most recent versions of Html, Css and Js.

As a huge fan of Stranger Things I've made those 2 clocks based on season 4, wich a clock plays an important role throughout the story. Even though in the first seen you have 2 of them on the screen, they are actually just one, on the left side you have our clock from the normal world, while in the right side you've got the same clock, but from the upised-down universe.

By making this personal project I was able to sharp my skills in the used technologies.

As a prospective full-stack developer, the efforts to get this work done really added up to my experience and my learning as a student of software engineering.

Dont forget to click on the clocks, there are 2 smalls easter eggs for the fans ;)P
